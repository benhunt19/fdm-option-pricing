# Applied Computational Finance - Class Test (2025)

## Overview
This repository contains solutions and implementations for the **Applied Computational Finance** class test, focusing on **Finite Difference Methods (FDM)** for solving partial differential equations in option pricing.

## Contents
- **Explicit Finite Difference Method**: Forward-time, centered-space (FTCS) approach.
- **Implicit Finite Difference Method**: Backward-time, centered-space (BTCS) approach.
- **Crank-Nicolson Method**: A combination of explicit and implicit methods for stability and accuracy.
- **Boundary Conditions & Stability Analysis**.

## Setup
To run the provided code, ensure you have:
- **C++ (or MATLAB/Python)** installed.
- A working compiler/interpreter.
- Necessary numerical libraries if applicable.
